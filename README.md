This code produces an enhancement for a UE3 FPS game by adding drawing functionality and automatic rotation toward opponents. It produces a dll which needs to be inserted into the game's memory. From there, it's hooked onto UE3 methods and basically allows you to develop the game as if you were the game developer.

To get it working, you'll need the UE3 SDK for the correct version of the game. Change a few configucation items and compile. Start the game and injected the library.
